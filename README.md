The Development Process is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the InShare Website.

## Implementation Process

* Made use of the above-mentioned functionality and technologies to implement the specific features.
* MERN design architecture implemented

## Highlights

* Collaborative Development Process:
Working in a group allows for a collaborative development process in building a Q&A platform using the MERN stack. With multiple team members, you can allocate tasks efficiently, dividing responsibilities among frontend (using React), backend (with Node.js and Express), and database management (using MongoDB). This collaboration ensures that different components are developed simultaneously, streamlining the overall development timeline and allowing for faster iteration and feedback loops.

* Diverse Skill Sets and Ideas:
Each team member brings unique skills and ideas to the table. Some excel in frontend design and user experience, while others specialise in backend architecture or database optimisation. Leveraging these diverse skill sets and perspectives ensures a comprehensive approach to problem-solving and enhances the quality of the Q&A platform. It allows for the incorporation of various features and functionalities that cater to the needs of users while optimizing performance and user experience.

## Challenges

* Coordination and Communication:
One significant challenge is coordinating the efforts of all team members, especially when working on different components of the MERN stack. Synchronization becomes crucial as frontend, backend, and database development need to align seamlessly. Ensuring effective communication and synchronization among team members is vital to avoid conflicts in code integration, functionalities, or design.

* Differing Skill Levels and Approaches:
The Team members have varying skill levels and approaches to problem-solving or coding practices. While diversity in skill sets can be an asset, it can also pose a challenge in terms of maintaining consistency and standard practices throughout the project. Differences in coding styles, architectural preferences, or understanding of the technologies can sometimes lead to conflicts.

* Implementation of Github:
When multiple team members are working on the same repository or the same files simultaneously, there's a chance of encountering merge conflicts. This occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. Resolving these conflicts can be complex and time-consuming, requiring careful manual intervention to ensure the changes integrate seamlessly.

## Reviews & Testing

# Feedback from Reviews
Peer Reviews were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:
* Make sure the user cannot upvote or downvote his own posts
* Have the user be able to change his profile picture
* Make sure there is consistency between the names of features (Such as Tags)

# Future Implementation
* Allow users to log into different Subject Q&A's in order to allow anyone from any department to use the inShare Platform.
